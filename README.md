# Frontend Mentor – Social Proof Section Solution

This is my solution to the **Social Proof Section** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
The challenge helped me improve my **HTML and CSS skills** by building a fully responsive layout that presents user reviews and ratings with an attractive design.

## Overview
This project is a **static landing section focused on social proof**.  
The goal is to display a product’s positive reputation through:
- A hero message
- Rating blocks from different platforms
- Customer testimonials with profile pictures

The interface features:
- A clean and responsive layout  
- Balanced visual hierarchy between text, ratings and testimonials  
- Desktop and mobile background patterns that adjust automatically  
- Consistent spacing and typography for readability  

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the layout correctly on **all screen sizes**.   
- Read ratings and testimonials clearly on both desktop and mobile.

## My Process
1. Started by structuring the layout using **semantic HTML** with a focus on readability and accessibility.  
2. Applied **Flexbox** to position each major block: header text, ratings and testimonial cards.  
3. Implemented a fully responsive design using **media queries** and fluid sizes.  
4. Alternated between **desktop and mobile background patterns** depending on screen width.  
5. Styled rating badges and testimonial cards using **CSS variables**, **spacing tokens**, and consistent **border-radius** values.  
6. Adjusted layout offsets using `nth-child` to recreate the staggered card positions shown in the original design.
